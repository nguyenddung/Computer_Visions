# ðŸ“Š Image Clustering Lab - KMeans with Brightness Feature

This lab demonstrates how to cluster images using the **KMeans algorithm** based on a simple feature: the **average brightness (intensity)** of each image.

---

## ðŸš€ Overview

- **Goal**: Group similar images by their average brightness using unsupervised learning.
- **Algorithm**: [`KMeans`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html) from `scikit-learn`.
- **Feature**: Total intensity (normalized brightness) of RGB images.
